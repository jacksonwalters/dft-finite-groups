# [modular, unitary] DFT of [cyclic group, symmetric group] over [finite fields, number fields]
 
Implements the discrete Fourier transform for the cyclic group and symmetric group over finite fields, and number fields in the unitary case. 

For finite fields, when $p$ divides $|G|$ we use the modular DFT, which is given by the Peirce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents.
